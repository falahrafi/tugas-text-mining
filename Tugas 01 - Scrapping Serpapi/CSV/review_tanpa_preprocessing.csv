PO HOtel Semarang,Cat tseng,3.0,"Old hotel badly maintained. Pictures on the web do not serve as accurate depictions. Upon arriving on our floor the 10th floor, when the lift doors open the first thing we note is the condition of the ceiling right smack in our face. The ceiling had dark brown mould on it and parts of the ceiling had broke also. The carpet had an old moudly stench. Lift to rooms has room key scanner but not in use so anyone can come up to the rooms even non hotel guests. Why would they install a card scanner if it wasn't being used? Carpet in the corridor and rooms look worn out. Edges of bathtub have rusty edges. Tap at the sink is tough to even turn on the water. Stains on bedsheets,sofa and carpet. Bathmat, towels, face towels are actually tattered at the edges. How can the hotel still use the ammenities? No hand towels were available also. Towels look worn and greyish white. They had stains on them. Hotel did not provide glasses or cups at the bathroom for brushing teeth. Room seems to be dusty as my son's allergy acted up. Water pressure's strong except it was so hard to work the tap at the sink. Shower in the bathroom is bad. Water trickles not shower. Hot water was minimal. Yellow mould was all over the sides of the edges. Rusty cracked parts of the hand shower area had sharp parts. Very dangerous for children. Such a pity this hotel is poorly maintained. Service standarda also fall far from 5 star standards. During breakfast time we witnessed the staff clearing up the breakfast buffet at 10 and none were wearing gloves. It seems all very unhygenic. Breakfast closes at 10 and we were the laat guests for breakfast. Every staff were busy clearing up the foods. So we have to be quick to get whatever breakfast we could. Ordering from the staff for even coffee was greeted by, "" this is the last one ya Ibu this is already 10am"". If only they could keep up the hotel's so called 4 or 5star standards this hotel could be a really good stay considering the location right next to the mall. Just one stay here is enough. Totally not worth the money paid for. We didn't bother to complain to the hotel too even though we are due to check out tomorrow considering all the complaints I've read online. It seems the hotel just apologizes but does not take action. Some past complaints were months ago. Please work very much harder to make the hotel a more welcoming place for guests. I wouldn't think we will be back again. Please be warned if you decide to stay in this hotel."

PO HOtel Semarang,Raymond Valiant Ruritan,4.0,My stay went well. I enjoyed the acces and service of the hotel. This hotel is just atop the Paragon mall. The ambience and environment is also nice. I enjoyed my stay albeit it was short. The staff was helpful and the service is acceptable. One area of improvement is the buffet breakfast. I kindly suggest to put more attention at the CoVid-19 protocol implementation. Service staff must use handgloves and masks all the time. Visitors are required to obey the rules within the restaurant.
PO HOtel Semarang,Manoj Bhat,4.0,The hotel is a very nice place to stay in Semarang but the parking is really a problem for those who drive in. One of the worst driving lanes for parking I have seen in my life. In fact the wall and divider is so full of paint from bruises that cars before mine seem to have created a crazy graffiti that you will find hard to avoid contributing to.. A sad situation to have for a property so prime..

PO HOtel Semarang,L Sam,5.0,"This hotel has changed management several times. This time is PO Hotel. What I like is its strategic location, next to the Paragon Mall. My stay was a business travel during the month of Ramadhan. The restaurant was crowded. It offered various dishes for Iftar (dinner) and way fewer dishes for sahur. The food quality was so so, but the lamb was the favourite among the guests."
PO HOtel Semarang,Abdullah Saif,2.0,"Couldve been better. We were arrived at 4pm just to found out that 2 out of 3 rooms werent ready yet. Room was old, poor maintenance, stains all over carpets, sofa, mold on the corner. Bathroom design is wrong in so many level IMO, poor design, poor execution Carpets in all floor and room (10th floor) with stains all over, and not really recommended if you have asthma or allergy. Not sure if it is because of pandemic thingy, but this hotel needs a lot of improvement to do. Such a waste of money"
PO HOtel Semarang,Miko Bayuaji,1.0,"I'm staying today (april 22nd 2022) in this hotel and planned to check out on monday april 25th 2022 but i will just check out tomorrow due to some problem with my room. My room number is 1009. I have a local rain in my room. It's such a special bonus from tropical country's hotel, which is quite famous for its heavy rain weather. They said that my room has some leakage problem with the ac and they just act like it is a regular problem. This ridiculous thing supposed to be not happened in hotel that claim has 5 star. No body apologize as it is just regular problem. They just give a cold call and weird unsincere sorry from phone after i get angry to their engineer. Even they dont pay attention to my gender call after so many times i explain them to call me mr rather than mrs / madam. The worse thing is they even dont have in room dining service after 9.30 PM. This hotel is located in central java's capital city but i really feel that i stay in a secluded village with its natural rain. Their towels are even worse. It looks like a mop rather than bath towel. To make it short, dont waste your money to stay in the hotel. You can find better hotels in semarang and cheaper. Luckily my office paid for this room. I even feel pity that my office need to pay for this stupid room."
PO HOtel Semarang,Eric Wijanta,3.0,Rooms are quite nice and neat...but the biggest let down was that the AC wasn't cold. It stayed around room temperature at approx. 26-27' C eventhough the settings were set to lowest...Rooms: 3/5 | Service: 4/5 | Location: 5/5 ‚Ä¶More

PO HOtel Semarang,Krishna Wiharsa,2.0,"Conveniently integrated to Paragon Mall and in the heart of Semarang city. Service could be improved.

PO HOtel Semarang,Curious Fingers,4.0,"Only stayed 1 night before returning home. Check in took an hour because we ordered connecting rooms or at lease side-by-side rooms (confirmed) but at the time unavailable. For info, we checked in after 2.30 pm. After some pushing, the staff gave us upgraded rooms on 11th floor. The rooms were freezing, so the whole night we turned off all AC. TV wasn't interesting, internet also was barely there, so kids kept on using indosat, which had to be near window. View was excellent, esp at night. Staffs friendly. There's ironing board inside closet although we didn't use it, but surely would be handy when staying longer. Amenities weren't complete, we had to ask for towels and bathroom mat. No tea, no sandals, no pen and paper, and no lock in bathrooms. Bathtub-room door was sliding type, so my toddler couldn't play in tub without flooding the whole room. The good side, it had clothes line. There's shower and closet inside with regular glass doors. Sink was draining slow. I think the bed was too soft, but luckily it didn't cause backpain in the morning. Breakfast was... kids didn't eat much u know. Definitely won't stay again here. The plus was the hotel's right beside mall, so have fun exploring."

PO HOtel Semarang,Rio,2.0,Good workout facility. Good breakfast with instant ginger from Sidomuncul. However the room we were really really disappointed with the suite room. The carpet was soft but it had so much dust bunny build up. The TV connection was really poor. The toilet couldn't flush properly. We got to go to the club lounge but no one took us there so we had to find it by ourselves. Really not worth staying at the suite room. A normal standard room would have maybe been okay. In total quite disappointed and would not recommend for group setting hotel stay.
PO HOtel Semarang,Yochan Rayon,3.0,"Hotel location almost perfect, on top of Paragon Mall, but with security unto consideration. They separated public area and room floors, and elevator to room floors can only accessible using card key as it's supposed to. The room was great, spacious. They had almost everything. Hotel staffs are nice and helpful, but room service were clumsy. On the first day, they forgot to put shower gel, and on the second day they pick up our bath mat and put nothing as replacement. Other sad thing was the food. Breakfast and catering for meeting lunch can't be said good nor satisfying. Some food are too salty, and the ""fried beef chinese something"" is difficult to chew, almost like chewing rubber band.... Hope they can improve ^^¬°"
PO HOtel Semarang,christantosuryo,5.0,"Actually a very comfy hotel, but if you bring car here, it's such a mess in the way out because of the mall, which in the same place.

PO HOtel Semarang,Julia,5.0,"Great location close to the airport and very nice and clean rooms. The only thing I found odd was that they had metal scanners at all the entrances to the hotel but you don't put your bags through them and security barely inspect them so I'm not sure what they prevent. The rooms are pretty spacious, nicely designed with a lot of recessed lighting. The bathrooms include a shower with a separate bathtub and toilets include a bidet cover. What's nice is breakfast is included! While it's not the best, there's an assortment of cuisines so you can find what's to your liking."
PO HOtel Semarang,Raden Arief Nugroho,4.0,"One of the best hotels in Semarang. Recently they changed their name into PO Hotel. So IHG brand should not be used again to refer to the hotel.

PO HOtel Semarang,Colin H,3.0,It's probably one of the best hotels in the city...but that's not saying much given the options. The convenience of the mall directly downstairs is handy.

PO HOtel Semarang,Rangga Adhimulya,4.0,"A very nice hotel next to paragon mall, it has inside access to the mall. The hotel is clean with great hospitality from the staff. room is spacious.

Co-worker"
PO HOtel Semarang,Michelle Axille,1.0,"The hotel was just ok, but several guest eith kids were complaining that the ""smoking"" room has a very strong cigarette smell, luckily we got a ""non smoking"" room. They have 3 lifts going to the room floor, but only 2 working, that makes the traffing (going up and down) terrible, while they are running on full house.

PO HOtel Semarang,Mathieu Suhandynata,3.0,"A nice room and lobby, ruined by poor service by the check in counter. We arrived at 3pm and was told there was a mix up with our booking, and it took over 2 hours in order to accommodate us. On top of that, once we were given a room, they also told us the room wasn't ready yet... This was at 5pm! What hotel doesn't have their rooms ready by 5pm?? Standard check in policy is usually at 2pm. Disappointing start to our holidays."
PO HOtel Semarang,Stefanus Sugiarto,5.0,"It's still the best hotel in Semarang as of December 2015, as far as location, amenities, facilities, and services. Rooms at Crowne are a bit smaller than what we'd expect from a 5-star but other than that there is very little to complain about. The revamped breakfast and dinner buffet selections are superb. Though a bit pricy, they are definitely worth it. Pictures included."

PO HOtel Semarang,Karina Dewi,4.0,"Obviously, it's befitting to it's newest 5 star hotel in town rating. The minuses : swimming pool too close to breakfast area , I guess if you don't mind being a show to other guests, this is not a problem. Also swimming pool amenities is quite disappointing for a 5 star hotel. Then against if you are there for business who cares. But I do hate it that they allow smoking in the pool area. What if kids are there? Also other minus is that the no single twin bed room, even though I know that this is the norm with a lot of girls these days, I still think as a business hotel it's a must. Another, is that the bathroom is annoying. Be it the configuration or the partition of the bathroom. For I prefer a proper wall and door to prevent cold air from coming in to the bathroom. I also prefer being able to poop behind a door that is not a glass, even though it is frosted. Breakfast food is good with a wide selection. Be it Southern food or European food I seen it here. Sadly the local herbal drink , jamu, is of poor quality because they sugar and water it down. Which I think is disappointing cause I'm all for advertising our Indonesian heritage. But oh well, economic crisis, what can you say. I also like it that you get 2 fluffy pillows. Yes, in my book this earn additional point. It's connected to a mall, though I'm not a big fan of malls, it is safe to say it's easy for food acquiring purposes. Another minus you ask? Ofc the b**** price! But hey if you ok with it it's worth checking the place while it still have that new tag."
PO HOtel Semarang,Vena Gustyani,3.0,"The hotel are great. It just in some place, the ceiling have yellow spots. They have lot of variety food, but the taste need to be fix"
PO HOtel Semarang,marsya sinta,3.0,"we didn't get non-smoking room even though we travelled with a child. The service are standard, unlike what i was expected. I wouldn't recommend guest with their own vehicle to sleep in this hotel. We arrived quite late and my dad have to park the car himself just to pay for valet service the next day. The service is that slow. The next day I found out we have to go to 6th floor to this ""special floor"" for hotel guest, turns out the floor is not only for hotel guest and are packed with the mall visitor. From the 6th floor we have to use the elevator to enter the hotel then change to another one to go to our floor. Good room, but Way too much effort for me."
PO HOtel Semarang,Amir Rostam Dokht,5.0,The hotel is very nice with a good location. The breakfast is perfect. The staff are nice. Very nice mall is next to it. Oh ya... Dot forget to taste their Fried Rice. It was good
PO HOtel Semarang,Dhedy Gunawan Wong,2.0,"The hotel looks old and not maintained properly. Furnitures are old and stained. Air conditioner in the lobby area is so hot. I stayed on the 12th floor. The carpet in the hallway is SO SO dirty. Stained everywhere, looks disgusting. It looked like it hasnt been cleaned for ages. For the room, the lighting is so minimum, its quite dark. Not good for working. SO MANY MOSQUITOS! My legs were constantly bitten while sitting in the room. Old matress and furniture. Not properly maintained. Overall experience is not so satisfactory compared to when it was handled by Crown. I stayed in Crown in 2014. Definitely didnt have so much to complain back then."
PO HOtel Semarang,Richard Gabriel Garcia,5.0,"By Indonesian standards, this is a nice hotel placed in the ""paragon"" commercial structure so very convenient for any need, very friendly and polite staff and above all they are all extremely nice and friendly.

But at 1405 the front office (Ibu Ayu) told me that she can not give me the room I ordered. What??? I thing this hotel need to improve their reservation system quality. Waited until 1420, with no info to check in. One other thing: the lobby is quite hot. The front office put a fan to keep them cool. üòä"

PO HOtel Semarang,Michael Williams,1.0,"The smoking rooms are a health hazard, not regularly deep cleaned: As a non-smoking room wasn't available, we booked a smoking room thinking it would compare to other smoking rooms we had previously stayed in, with only a mild scent of tobacco. But stepping out of the elevator on the 9th floor there was already a strong smell of smoke. Inside the room it was overwhelming. Knowing how bad it was, they had placed a large portable air purifier in the room. This was comical as they could have added nine more and it would have had no effect. Instead, they should be regularly deep cleaning the carpet, drapes, upholstery, etc. which clearly they don't do. We spoke to the evening manager working on the 14th and asked for a non-smoking room which he refused to give without us paying an upgrade charge of an additional IDR 1,500,000 / $115. They know how bad these rooms are but still required us to pay. So we stayed in our original room and I woke up with a headache which I'm certain was caused by the air in the room. On a positive note, other than this, the rooms, pool, gym, and hotel overall are great. The staff are amazing. If you can get a non-smoking room, I'd recommend the hotel. But until they start regularly deep cleaning the smoking rooms, for your health I'd avoid those."

Also, they call the pit if coffee ""Arabica"" so ask for that if you want a refill. The fitness center had TV's on the treadmills that didn't work for two weeks even though ""the technician was called.""

Moreover, this place is located near Brebes Railway Station, local market, and Yogya Toserba. The only problem was the water heater in my room. It heated the water too hot and I couldn't really adjust the temperature."
Grand Dian Hotel Brebes,Kannia Nur Ovida,3.0,"(Translated by Google) Very strategic location. close to yogya, and close to the station. The rooms are clean. The food is delicious. It's just that, at 10 o'clock the housekeeping team was already knocking on the door to clean the room. Even though I was still getting ready for the event in the back hall. even though the checkout deadline is 12. (Original) Lokasi sangat strategis. ke yogya deket, dan deket dari stasiun. Kamar nya bersih. makanannya enak. Hanya saja, masih jam 10 tim housekeepingnya sudah ketuk pintu untuk membersihkan ruangan. Padahal saya masih bersiap siap untuk acara di aula belakangnya. padahal batas checkout jam 12."
Grand Dian Hotel Brebes,Muhammad Ghazi Al Jazary,4.0,"(Translated by Google) This hotel is located on the side of the main road in Brebes City. I think it's very strategic. Next to it, there is a Yogya department store, there is a Brebes train station as well, a short walk away, there is a very busy market. Near the place by by too. Anyway, easy access everywhere. Even though the hotel is not that big, it's only three floors. But the hotel is nice and clean. The service is also good. Breakfast delivered to the room. And it tastes good too. Get rice plus side dishes, fruit, coffee and milk. I ordered a standard room which cost 550 thousand. The rooms are good, but the lack of all standard rooms has no windows. So a bit cramped for me and my family. If you want one with a window, a deluxe room costs 850 thousand. I didn't take it, because I only transited overnight while going home yesterday oh yes, at the reception yesterday my husband asked for a standard room and he said it was out. My turn to ask is still there. How the hell, my advice, make sure once when you book a room. Because the receptionist was not honest with the availability of rooms. The rest is good, I think (Original) Hotel ini terletak di pinggir jalan besar Kota Brebes. Sangat strategis sih menurut saya. Samping nya ada toserba Yogya, ada stasiun KA Brebes juga, jalan sedikit lagi ada pasar yg ruame sekali. Dekat tempat oleh oleh juga. Pokoknya akses kemana mana mudah. Hotel nya biarpun tidak begitu besar, hanya tiga lantai. Tetapi hotel nya bagus dan bersih. Pelayanan nya juga bagus. Sarapan di antar ke kamar. Dan rasa nya juga enak. Dapat nasi plus lauk pauk,buah,kopi dan juga susu. Saya pesan kamar standar yang seharga 550 ribu. Kamar nya sih bagus,tetapi kurang nya di semua kamar standar tidak ada jendela nya. Jadi agak sumpek untuk saya dan keluarga. Jika mau yg ada jendela nya kamar deluxe seharga 850rb. Saya tidak ambil itu, karena saya kan hanya transit semalam ketika mudik saja kemarinüòÅ oh iya, pas di resepsionis kemarin suami saya tanya kamar standar dan katanya sudah habis. Giliran saya yang tanya masih ada. Bagaimana sihüòì saran saya pastikan sekali pas memesan kamar. Karena di resepsionis nya kurang jujur dengan ada nya ketersediaan kamar. Selebih nya sih bagus semua menurut sayaüôè"

The Winner Hotel Pemalang,Lian Harumi,3.0,"(Translated by Google) ""Disappointing"" Even though I stayed here 3 days ago In an air conditioned room. The service is good, the facilities are ready, basically All done. And I like. But now on 23.05.22 I try to stay in a room without AC. I was so surprised when I found the room. The sheets had holes, even the towel facilities I had to wait for about 1 hour. And it was only given 1 towel, said the cleaning room was still not dry üòÇ Basically the service is different Like a king and the poor If you can even rent a towel, I'll definitely pay for it. I also found an employee lying in an empty room Next time don't be like that.... You guys sell services, so whatever the customer's room choice is, whether it's expensive or cheap Better give your best service IT'S NOT NATURALLY THE CUSTOMMER WHO STAYS IN THE CHEAP ROOM AT YOUR HOTEL IS POOR..... AND DON'T JUDGE PEOPLE FROM THE OUTSIDE COVER Hopefully in the future The Winner hotel can be more advanced and the service will also get better. THANK YOU. (Original) ""Mengecewakan"" Padahal saya menginap disini 3 hari lalu Di kamar yg ber AC. Pelayanannya bagus fasilitas telah siap,pokokx All done. Dan saya suka. Tapi saat ini tgl 23.05.22 saya mencoba menginap di kamar yg tanpa Ac. Begitu kaget saya ketika mendapati kamarnya. Seprainya berlubang, sampai fasilitas handuk saja saya harus menunggu sekitar 1jam. Dan itu hanya di beri 1 handuk saja kata cleaning roomnya masih belum kering ü§£üòÇ Pokokx pelayannanya beda Bagai raja dan kaum duafa ü§£ü§£ü§£ Andai bisa sewa anduk pun lo pasti gw bayar. Saya jg mendapati ada pegawai yg tiduran di bad kamar yg kosongü§îü§´ Lain kali jangan seperti itulah.... Kalian kan menjual JASA jd apapun pilihan kamar custommer mau yg mahal atau yg murah Sebaiknya BERIKAN LAYANAN kalian Yg terbaik BELUM TENTU CUSTOMMER YANG MENGINAP DI KAMAR YANG MURAH DI HOTEL KALIAN ITU ORANG MISKIN..... DAN JANGAN MENILAI ORANG DARI COVER LUARNYA Semoga kedepannya The Winner hotel bisa semakin maju dan layanannya jg semakin membaik. TERIMA KASIH."

I hope the quality can be improved. (Original) Dapat connecting room lt 3, suasana kamar unik, konsep antariksa. Di setiap kamar di sediakan AlQuran dan Sajadah.

Premiere Hotel Tegal,Rudi Muliyono,3.0,"(Translated by Google) This hotel must have been great in its heyday. However, now it is starting to get neglected. Are there cobwebs on the ceiling, plastic water faucets? Come on! The room smelled of cigarette smoke even though you ordered a non smoking room. We ordered 2 twin rooms but the other one was both single beds combined into 1 and closed with a queen size bed sheet. When complained, instead of two single beds being separated and given each other's bed sheets, our friend was moved to another floor with a worse room. The good thing is the mattress and pillows are comfortable. Friendly reception and security staff. (Original) Hotel ini pastinya bagus di masa kejayaannya. Namun, sekarang mulai tak terawat. Ada sarang laba2 di plafon, kran air dari plastik? Come on! Kamar berbau asap rokok meski pesan non smoking room.

Saat dikomplain, bukannya dua ranjang single dipisah dan diberikan bed sheet masing2, teman kami malah dipindah ke lantai lain dengan kamar yang lebih buruk. Hal yang bagus adalah kasur dan bantalnya nyaman. Staff resepsionis dan security ramah."

Anggraeni Hotel Ketanggungan,neea monthria,2.0,"(Translated by Google) The place was clean but unfortunately when I got there the room leaked badly until the water was inundated. After complaining and waiting 10 minutes, the place was cleaned and lightly said oh it leaked from above, there was no apology because the guests' comfort was disturbed or apologized because it took time to find a mop (profit for luggage, etc. not put below). Even though this good room is not a standard room, you know. There are more officers who don't understand what the task is. At that time there was an event and brought quite famous talent. Officers play with nodong asking for photos regardless of whether the guest is comfortable or not. Even though it's been said if later you can photograph together after the event. Fortunately, I don't compare with the talent. Hufft. Oh yes the employees are also fond of huddling in the front lobby. So if you want to find an officer, go to the lobby. nice breakfast can be brought into the room because the SOP is also unclear. So basically this is a hotel with less service and if there are other options you don't need to stay here. (Original) Tempatnya sih bersih tapi sayang pas sy ke sana kamarnya bocor parah sampai air tergenang. Setelah komplen dan nunggu 10 menitan, tempat baru dibersihkan dan dengan enteng dibilangnya oh ini bocor dari atas, ga ada permintaan maaf krn kenyamanan tamu terganggu atau minta maaf karena butuh waktu utk mencari pel (untung koper, dll ga ditaruh di bawah). Padahal ini kamar yg bagus bukan kamar standar lho. Petugas yg ada lebih banyak yg ga mengerti tugasnya apa. Sy waktu itu lg ada event dan membawa talent yg lumayan terkenal. Petugas main dateng nodong minta foto tanpa memperdulikan apakah si tamu nya nyaman atau tidak. Padahal sdh dibilang kalo nanti bisa foto bareng2 sesudah event. Untungnya sy ga dikomplen ama si talent itu. Hufft. Oh ya karyawannya juga doyan ngerumpi di lobby depan. Jd kalo mau cari petugas, ngeloyor ajah ke lobby. enaknya sarapan bisa di bawa ke dalam kamar krn SOP juga ga jelas. Jd intinya ini hotel dgn pelayanan yg kurang dan kalo ada pilihan lain mending ga usah stay di sini."
