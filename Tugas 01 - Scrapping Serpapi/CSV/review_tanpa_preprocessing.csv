Restoran EKA RIA,Dixie Xie,5.0,"This is my first time to get here to celebrate my dad's birthday. This place is family chinese restaurant that have good ambience and for elderly. Some positive things : - They have lift to reach restaurant area (we can take our family member with wheelcair easily here) - Nice and clean place - Excellent service - Great food taste and they have some unique & signature menu that not found in other resto. Tips & Trick: - Make sure you have RESERVATION before you get here. Otherwise, you should wait other people finish and it will take more than 30 mins in peak hour. - They have limited parking lot. It's better if you can come earlier. Or if you arrive during peak hour (lunch / dinner), be ready to have plan B on where you can park your car. My Order (all in SMALL size): Sate Shanghai 154K Bakmi Ulang Tahun 83K Burung Dara Jit Lok Joen 90K Pocai Cah 88K Angsio Tahu 99K Lindung Cah Fumak 116K Will get back here for sure to try ""Nasi Manis"" that not available today.

Restoran EKA RIA,Cherie,5.0,"What a nostalgic place to go to. Not surprisingly, the delicious food haven't changed since I last visited 6 years ago. The food quality is and always has been great and consistent over the years. The place is also spacious for events serving excellent food. And the value the restaurant gives is something that would make me come back for more! Parking: Best to get here earlier. If there are events in the restaurant, they would hog the parking space first."

Restoran EKA RIA,Risnawan Muliadi,4.0,"(Translated by Google) Delicious Chinese food from a legendary restaurant in Jakarta. Angtomie is a noodle with Eka Ria's signature crab soup that is a must try. The two-flavored carp and the Shanghai spring rolls are delicious. The dishes are directly cooked by the master chef, who is also the owner (third generation). The service is very good, the waitress is always ready to help, even the parking attendant is the same. The restaurant is elderly and disabled friendly because it provides lifts and special toilets for wheelchair users. Every Wednesday and Friday there are dance activities in the ballroom dance floor 1. (Original) Masakan Cina yg enak dari resto legendaris di Jakarta. Angtomie merupakan bakmi dengan sup kepiting khas Eka Ria yg harus dicoba. Ikan Gurame Dua Rasa dan Lumpia Shanghai-nya maknyus. Masakannya langsung dimasak oleh master chef, yg sekaligus owner (generasi ketiga). Pelayanan sangat bagus, waitress selalu siap membantu, bahkan juru parkir pun sama.

Restoran EKA RIA,Jessica C,4.0,"(Translated by Google) 1. Cah Rock Frog In my opinion, this menu is a must order, the frog meat is big and very soft. The type of sauce is thick and cooked with red wine, so it smells really good. In addition to frogs, this menu also has pieces of mushrooms and onions that make it even more delicious. 2. Angtomie The noodles are actually ordinary boiled noodles, what's unique is the sauce, they use a thick red sauce with a mixture of crab meat. The taste is sweet and savory, even though it looks plain but it tastes quite good, and because there are scallions, it smells better. 3. Shrimp Spring Rolls The hallmark of this menu is its kietna sauce (a type of orange sauce). The texture is crispy and soft in the middle. (Original) 1. Kodok Batu Cah Menu ini wajib dipesan sih menurutku, daging kodoknya besar' dan lembut banget. Tipe saucenya yang kental dan dimasak dengan arak merah gitu jadi wangi banget. Selain kodok menu ini juga ada potongan jamur dan bawang bombai yang bikin makin nikmat. 2. Angtomie Mienya sebenarnya mie rebus biasa, yang unik adalah kuahnya, mereka pakai kuah kental berwarna merah dengan campuran daging kepiting. Rasanya manis dan gurih, walau kelihatannya polos tapi rasanya cukup enak, dan karena ada daun bawangnya jadi lebih wangi. 3. Lumpia Udang Ciri khas dari menu ini adalah saus kietna-nya (sejenis saus jeruk). Teskturnya garing dan lembut bagian tengahnya."

The food was good but since I‚Äôve got some restrictions with the diet, the menu is quite limited. Most of the food is spicy and use coconut milk, as I couldn‚Äôt eat both at this time.

There's no sign full before your car enter the place."
Medja Restaurant,Tasya Khalida,5.0,"Beautiful restaurant with an excellent food taste and interior. I just love how their interior really boosted my mood. Indoor and semi-outdoor area have a nice AC temperature, so it's a comfortable place to have a talk, eat, and taking pictures. Their prices are very worthy compared to it's taste and place. One menu has a big portion that can be shared to 2-3 people. Worth it!"
Medja Restaurant,Dewi Indiani,5.0,We came on Christmas day for dinner and the queue was pretty long yet we decided to keep waiting. Not sure if it would be that long on normal days. Turned out their service was worth the waiting. Food came quickly although we didn‚Äôt order in advance while waiting. Their staff was very helpful and accommodating. Their food was as good as advertised. Oxtail soup was superb.
Medja Restaurant,Josh H,4.0,"First time in here to have lunch. Park space? Not too big but enough for 30-40 cars. Food vs price? Not too fit because premium price only about place but not for food quality. Toilet? Only 1 for man and 1 for woman. Too little for the number of pax. Place? Actually were nice with outdoor seating. Recommended? Not for now if thinking about toilet number, food quality & park space."
Medja Restaurant,XY Fuwa,5.0,"Food taste so-so. A good place if you're into a fancy place to took a photos Good place to hangout with friends or colleagues. Has indoor and outdoor rooms. Clean restaurant, pool, surrounding. Good services and nice and kind employee. Good COVID-19 protocol, each tables got it own a bottle of hand sanitizer. Clean toilet. Have a free wifi. Might need a waiting time if you went here in weekend or holidays. We went to here is weekdays, so we didn't face waiting time Accept cashless payment."
Medja Restaurant,Rachel Mustika,5.0,"I had bitterballen and the drinks. The drinks were blue ocean, mint tea and coffee. The food and the drink was delicious. The environment is quite cool even though it was outdoor. The price was quite pricey as it was like any other cafes. I suggest to come early so, you don't need to wait."
Medja Restaurant,jouhara assofa,5.0,"Excellent services‚Ä¶ so far the taste of the food is good. maybe i could say the price is quite pricey, but worth it because it tastes good. But the Highlights is their service, not only because the staff has good hospitality . they also gave ice cream as an apology because there was an order that took a while to come out. if you go to bogor you must visit MEDJA RESTAURANT"
Medja Restaurant,Raditya Nandiasa,4.0,"Food tasted so-so. Black pepper beef, fried noodle, and tumis daun pepaya way too salty to my liking. Matcha latte too sweet even for my sweet tooth. Nice place and ambience. To be honest, 3.5 stars from me."
Medja Restaurant,Catur J. Sutrisno,4.0,Perfect place to hang out. Excellent ambient and delicious foods and beverages. Huge parking lot and they manage the business really well from the queues to the friendly staffs. They have indoor and outdoor area and also mini swimming pool for taking a picture
Medja Restaurant,Agnes Sugiarto,2.0,"Trying Medja Restaurant after always canceling due to crowds and queues. In this visit, me and my friend ordered Iga Sapi Bakar (grilled ribs served with mashed potato and cream spinach), Sate Platter (mixed skewers with chicken, beef, shrimp and squid), Tahu Sumpel (bean curd stuffed with veggies and meat in Medja style) and Nasi Hijau (seasoned green rice). In my opinion, Medja food is pretty nice. However, I didn't get the hype, since taste wise it isn't that spectacular. The ambience of the place is pretty cozy and nice. But maybe it isn't just match with my palate. For this visit to Medja Restaurant, i'm gonna rate them 2.45 out of 5. For more info about foods, kindly visit asmunchkin on IG."
Medja Restaurant,Langga Calvareno,5.0,"Very amazing restaurant in Bogor City, West Java The building, the interior, atmosphere, lightning, is awesome The service is very good, the staff is really friendly and nice The food is really good, from the plating, to the taste itself The price is okay, a bit expensive but very worth it The parking lot is good and spacious"
Medja Restaurant,meydia x,4.0,"If u want to find hidden gem for just relax, take a short break & enjoy ur day with a cup of coffee, tea or sparkling water to accompany u then come to Medja restaurant. The concept of it was sit together in the table and eat the food while chit-chat either with ur family or ur friends. U will discover the place with high ceiling building with indoor and outdoor space. Don't forget to make reservation before coming here as it always full booked or u need to queue. Due to its crowd, then sometimes it will be hard for calling the waiter/waitress, so be patient üòâ. The price for snacks or small bites still ok, however for the drinks and the main course quite expensive compares to the quality of foods. We ordered kroket bogor (it was nice if u ate it while hot, if already turned cold then no good). Another one is cigureng (not recommended at all although they gave star in menu book), asam-asam iga (this one star as the sour & the tasty is balance, recommended although the portion quite small), gurame betutu (the fish quite small & the taste not yet blend with the spices), papaya leaves (this one ok, papaya leaves not too bitter), nangka goreng caramel (this one also recommended as they serve it with ice cream). For the drinks, all are recommended, we ordered bandrek with ice (although small portion but taste is nice), pinky frizzy mint (forgot the name if not mistaken, this one also recommended even though the portion also small). Overall u pay the price for the scenery and the ambience of the place. For parking lots, they have lots. Please don't use google maps as the direction was wrong, u better ask people for the route."
Medja Restaurant,T Susatyo,4.0,"Very good atmosphere, really like the outdoor design concepts many photo spots, spacious parking space, good service, for food need to enhance more on tastes, ordered several food but tastes so so..Food: 2/5 | Service: 4/5 | Atmosphere: 5/5 ‚Ä¶More"
Medja Restaurant,Bobby Stiven,4.0,A very nice indonesian restaurant in Bogor. The food is very nice and the place itself is so pretty. The staff can be more knowledgeable about the menu though.
Medja Restaurant,Stevie Sulaiman,5.0,"Epic rib dish, esp the sauce. Nice flavor combination with the creamy spinach and mashed potatoes. Slightly more tender and slightly less dry may make the rib tastes more perfect, but that's probably just me and my wife's preference. Nice interior design, esp the one under the glass roof. May want to consider adding portable fan or portable aircon during this extreme weather the past few weeks."
Medja Restaurant,Te Ir,5.0,"The staurant placed in the city of rain Bogor with a large parking lot. an aesthetic, slang, luxurious and instagram friendly restaurant building. Food with authentic cutlery. I ordered the grilled ribs, the meat was soft and the spices were absorbed. Medja fried chicken can be option for shared menu, the portion is really big. romantic atmosphere at night, adding to the enjoyment when eating food. Highly recommended for culinary purposes in Bogor"
Medja Restaurant,Maya,4.0,Nice place to hang out with friends and family. They have outdoor n indoor seating area. I prefer the outdoor area which has more view. The food is ok. Good in plating but average in taste.
Medja Restaurant,Astrid Gannis,4.0,"Very pleasant lunch moment at Medja. I was skeptical when my friends took me to Medja since some of the dining places in Bogor just sell their place with not so good food & beverages taste. Turns out the food was delicious as good as their interior design. They served mostly Indonesian food btw. What needs to be improved is the servers focus on speed, like getting the menu to the new coming guests as fast as possible and delivering meals or cater the guest‚Äôs needs as soon as possible. It took me couple of times to call like i have to shout to the waitress even though my friend and I already rang the bell to call them and we also waited 40-45 minutes for our foods ready to serve and sadly they forgot 1 menu that my friend requested to serve. It‚Äôs like they haven‚Äôt properly trained. They just flock together in one place not spreads to the certain spot so that it will make the guests easier to call/need help. Even the guest beside my table with baby getting frustrated also. Please fix this."
Medja Restaurant,Wny Irw,3.0,"The food are only good, we ordered snacks, nangka goreng and bola ubi, the coffee were not recommended (not their specialty). Went here at 1pm on Monday. We waited for 15mnt to be seated, the staff said only outdoor seatings available. And they took us to smoking outdoor, beside parking lot, uncomfortable. Finally we asked to move to the table indoor, there are 10 indoor tables available. Overall, not having good atmosphere, it was crowded, noisy, and nothing special about this resto. We cannot think of any reason to come back here."
Medja Restaurant,benaya simeon,5.0,"Restaurant with variant options for Indonesia cuisine.. nice open air area, their cakes and dessert were incredible.. good ambience and decoration..."
Medja Restaurant,Deliana Deliana,5.0,Perfect place to hang out. Excellent ambient and delicious foods and beverages.

Medja Restaurant,Sufan Siauw,5.0,A really nice restaurant with plenty of Instagram spot. I was actually amazed with the food as well. Very surprised that the restaurant actually serves real tasty Indonesian food with attentive service all around.
Medja Restaurant,TNVL W,3.0,"The place is beautiful and classy designed especially at night, I really enjoyed it and the food was served unique, rustic style utensilsHowever for food was not too good as expected with the price they offered especially the Oxtail Sour Spicy soup (Buntut Pedas Asam) was very plain and greasy."
Medja Restaurant,Xtian Hyd,5.0,"The food taste of is tasty, always crowded And need to booking at first.Price quite medium.."
Medja Restaurant,Hera Zahara Maxoom,4.0,"Keep hunting for new culinary places, the goal turns out to be at Medja Restaurant... as usual, the first impression must be the location and the view, it turns out to be very Instagramable, and one more thing from the food, all the menus taste quite satisfying ü§î the service is very satisfying because it is very friendly üëåüëç"
Medja Restaurant,nata dhani,5.0,"Good food, good place, nice ambience. The food portion for each menu is approximately 3-4 person per menu. Quite fulfilling quantity too"
Medja Restaurant,Lorraine,3.0,"The ambience of the restaurant is great, but there are still lots of areas to improve, or can be improved. Reservation: - had trouble with the reservation at first but quickly solved by another staff member, overall no complaints. - had to pay 150k down payment per person, honestly i feel this is too expensive to pay in advance. I understand the restaurant needs assurance from the customer but many more upscale restaurants don't charge this much especially for Indonesian food (local food) - to reserve a private room, the minimum transaction is too high, also there's a 1mil fee for the room (totally not worth it) Food: - tastes good but nothing awesome or out of the ordinary - the soup (soto) was too bland for my taste - ayam taliwang didn't taste like taliwang at all, the spices were so bland and definitely not worth the price - nasi goreng tasted great - mie goreng also tasted great - the orange jelly dessert was great but still, nothing amazing - the grilled banana wasn't grilled at all, just barely put on a stove, with chocolate messes and cheese on top - the mocha cake didn't taste like mocha at all, more like chocolate cake? I even thought the staff brought the wrong cake - the carrot cake was good - the rest of the food (squid, chicken) were great - the prawns were my favorite, very fresh Drinks: - ordered some mocktails; didn't like any of them. Too sour or too sweet, no freshness at all. The sourness or sweetness overwhelmed everything else. - the ice tea didn't even have any refills for the price ?? (I find this outrageous and really really not worth it!) - the jamu (indonesian traditional drink) was too strong, but good Service: - overall service was awesome - food came quick, service was attentive Ambience: - 2 or 3 great spots to take pictures, the rest is a bit boring - perhaps add more fish? Or birds, or anything for children to play/see - restroom was dirty Overall, i will not recommend the restaurant. Maybe if you're curious, try it once but i feel the price is not worth it."
Medja Restaurant,rafa martinez,5.0,Very nice place for lunch.The food was very good and the place very beautiful.You have parking for your car.They check your body temperature.
Medja Restaurant,Faradilla Novadina,5.0,"The place is beautiful and the ambience is great. The food is also great, a little pricey but worth the place. My favorite is Tahu Lada Garam but was sold out because it was near closing time. The food portion is a little big for me. I ordered Nasi Goreng Kampung, it was good, there was a lot of chicken and meatballs. Tahu Sumpel was great, the fillings were full. Ayam Taliwang and Nasi Hijau were a great combination for one who likes spicey."

Medja Restaurant,Raisa Raha,4.0,"not really an ‚Äúinstagramable‚Äù place hunter, but even if you aren‚Äôt this place‚Äôs ambience is great. You really get to enjoy the beautiful interior. The food is quite pricey but so are other pretty restaurants and cafes. The food is just okay I think, but I do love that they serve Indonesian food instead of just western like in regular ‚Äúfancy restaurants‚Äù"
Medja Restaurant,Danang Setiawan,5.0,"Ambience nya nyaman sekali. Interior design nya makes me want to selfie. Love the restaurant interior design. Food nice taste, but little bit expensive. The waitress and waiters so kind. Also easy in payment methods, no need to wait in cashier line. Overall Iike this place well"
Medja Restaurant,Fajar Fajar,4.0,"Good place to hang out and taking a photo with, because there‚Äôs many photo spot to take the photo, thanks to cool and nicely design interior. Parking lot is spacious, the food is decent and okay-ish, big portion and typically sharing food with white rice, price is average consider the places. Security, bartender is friendly, waiters and staff is standart not so friendly, maybe because of this place popularity and waiting line."
Medja Restaurant,Annisa Muktiono,5.0,"Super love the place. Cozy, pretty design, and their health protocol is very good. Staffs are really helpful and friendly, although there is a little misunderstanding between staff and trainee in the reception. Foods are really delicious, iga bakar and sate platter are very recommended."
Medja Restaurant,Aditya Dwi Putra,4.0,This is the good place to have a meal and hanging. It has good decoration and peaceful place. But in my opinion the food taste is just so so. The beverage i ordered didnt reach my expectation also. Please paying attention to the food taste. It will be perfect place yet worth the price if you have tasteful food.
Medja Restaurant,Feliks Christono Sehan,5.0,The ambiance is really cozy and relax.Food quality quite good.. Interm of price reasonable.. Not overly charge... Good place for brunch lunch or dinner.. Service quite fast and responsive...
Medja Restaurant,Opiniku,5.0,"It's suitable place for lunch and dinner with family, friend/colleague or partner. The ambience like hotel or the fine dining restaurant. Plenty parking space, good and quick services. The food taste also good. But need improvement for the chair on waiting area."
Medja Restaurant,Jhon Wood,5.0,"Nice ambienceGood food, big portion and can be sharedReasonable price, consider the taste and portionKind staff"
Medja Restaurant,Alexandra Josephina,5.0,"Second time visiting Medja, and never dissapoint me. Before or during pandemic how they service the guest really impressive. With good food, good ambience, fair price, will def back for another time. Their marble beef steak really melts in my mouth I would say it was good one."
Medja Restaurant,Ratna Rediandary,5.0,"Great taste of Indonesian cuisine, love it !!Cozy place with unique ambience, perfect for enjoying lunch or dinner with family and your loved ones. A bit pricy thou, 50++ K for a menu, but worth for once a while üòâ"
Medja Restaurant,Diamond Diamond,3.0,"Best place for hangout with your beloved one. Great ambiance, super cozy. I came to break fasting with family without reservation, the outdoor area all already booked. Luckily, we got seat at indoor area. Not many variety of menu during Ramadhan, we can order only for the selected menu. When i asked why i cant order the regular menu, they said because it will be hectic due to breakfasting time. So we ordered chicken steak, chicken taliwang with separated steam rice, stir fry chicken dumplings, bandrek, bajigur, 2 mocktails, mineral water, fried stuffed tofu, and bitterbalen. It all cost almost Rp 600K. Frankly, the taste wasn't that good just average. Big portion for Chicken taliwang but small portion for the snacks. Compare to the price, i can say the meals are pricey. I will recommend this place if you have extra budget and if you want to spend an intimate time with your beloved. The meals itself not that good, just average taste. Afterall, great place to take photo, instagramable."
Medja Restaurant,dzakia drg,5.0,"All of their foods are delicious!!! My favourites are the prawns and colenak. Seriously, they uplifted the colenak into another level. You can also taste Indonesian traditional drinks called ""Jamu"". My suggestion is that you need to book in advance. However, you can't do it during the weekend, so you need to be there at least one hr before your schedule, because alot of people are lining up."
Medja Restaurant,micco moss,4.0,Place is beautiful with indoor & large outdoor areaFood is a bit priceyTaste ok
Medja Restaurant,Adit Nagata,3.0,Well 1 thing i like about this restaurant is the parking lot. Huge haha We ordered food before came in. I order fried rice but the waiter gave me friend noodle and they insist not to change and said it will take longer time. I said its ok. But 10 mins later the food come. Dafu* longer The fried rice is no taste at all dude. I prefer eat nasi goreng tek tek with 10 ribu rupiah and delicious Good place to drink only
Medja Restaurant,Mr. R,5.0,"Great and fancy restaurant with nice interior and ambience. It's spacious with huge indoor and outdoor area. The parking lot is huge too. Even though the price is above the average (for Bogor standard), but it's totally worth it, because almost all the food that we ordered were in huge portion and all satisfying. Must try their cheesy Bitterballen, Iga Penyet, and the fresh Asam-Asam Iga."
Medja Restaurant,Lia Lt,4.0,"My friends ordered nasi goreng kamoung and nasi goreng belacan, and they were great taste. I ordered Ice Americano with 2 desserts: mocha cake which was OK, not that really special, and Regal Thai Tea (this was OK too, but I think thai tea flavor is not something for a cake to my taste. Price is a bit above the average. Their interior and exterior are amazingly great. Comfortable, beautiful with cozy ambience both indoor and outdoor."
Medja Restaurant,Susanty L,4.0,"Nice ambience, nice interior, instagrammable, so many good spots to take picture. The menu price wise is good and come in generous portion, but the taste is so so in my opinion. Try the Kopi Medja and colenak, they are good . They are applying safety protocol and limiting the seats, so reservation is recommended."
Medja Restaurant,Dona Soedarno,5.0,"Luxurious hidden gem dinner spot with great atmosfer, really love the ambience, decorations ,the whole things, it is so romantic. Great place for friends, family, collegues fellowships.Great food ,too."
Medja Restaurant,Luthfiah Mamluatul Inayah,1.0,"In conclusion: OVERRATED! Bad experience and won‚Äôt consider to come back. Yes the interior was pretty cool. The service was so so. But the taste of the food????? With that price????? You seriously seriously need to consider to find another head chef cause come on, it was all too bland for Indonesian cuisine and you know it!! 1. Pindang cumi and soto kecombrang: bland, ga jelas rasanya mau arah kemana. 2. Empal: too sweet, not tender enough. 3. Sambal: lumayan. 4. Ayam tepung: bland, not cruncy enough. 5. Bakso goreng: the flour dominated the taste, too hard to chew. 6. Kangkung: bland, undercooked. 7. White and red rice: pera banget gustii 8. Pasta: a bit bland but ok for western food. Costumers come for the food y‚Äôall, you couldn‚Äôt satisfied our stomach with just the sceneryüò™. Not recommended."
Medja Restaurant,Poppy Lau,4.0,"New restaurant in Bogor City. Place really strategic and easy to find. Food variety mostly indonesian food. The taste quite good but for spicy lovers not full satisfied. Because all the ""Sambal"" really not spicy at all. While come here I was ordering Gurame Sambal Kecombrang, Sop Buntut Bangsawan and Soto Sapi Kecombrang. The good one there are alot of spot that instagrammable to fill your content üòÉ. üòç"

Medja Restaurant,Elizabeth Jonatan,5.0,First time visit the restaurant in era of new normal (so you could see the restaurant is taking seriously of coronavirus and they applied the social distancing including the tables). Ambience is pretty cool and cozy. The food is great and tasty. Parking is spacious. Would definitely comeback!
Medja Restaurant,Jani Soewanti,4.0,"Like the ambience, love the architecture, lust the interior design. But alas, not the food. I can totally understand of people seating there leisurely absorb the time spent chit chating over a cup of coffee and sweet dessert, relaxing amid tension of covid19. But being there for the food? I do not understand. Basically salty. All of it. Garang asam cumi, tumis genjer, mie goreng belacan, fried fish even the tahu sumpel. Okay, this is a review over my second visit. It was a hot day this time with hard winds and high humidity. Even the downward blinds hardly stop the winds. The food improvement is very noticeable in view of only one dish was salty (fried chicken, also very hard to chew). The fried noodle was quite nice, the squid also was acceptable, the oxtongue was less salty and genjer also longbeans were nice. Bravo! Ohya, superb crew, very attentiveüé∂‚ù§Ô∏è"
Medja Restaurant,gemi hartojo,5.0,Beautiful ambiance and very delicious food
Medja Restaurant,Kevin Adrykaputra,5.0,"Cheap and comforting food. Beef tongue sambal hijau comes with extra genorous beef tongue. Truly a delicacy. Bajigur is super tasty as well. Design and ambiance of restaurant is top notch as well.

Medja Restaurant,Halida Budining,5.0,"I was amazed with restaurant which has their own huge parking lot, makes the customer easier to park. Been there in New Normal time due to Covid 19, they're manage healhty procedures very well & strict. The place was incredible & instagramable, the food & beverages also very delicious. I tried some menu and surprisingly they're all delicious. The staffs also friendly & helpful. Good location, and a bit pricey, but it's okay. Two thumbs up."
Medja Restaurant,Nathania Alethea,5.0,"Very great architecture. Different ambience created for every corner. Indoor or outdoor both fine. True aesthetic place, definitely worth a visit! Absolutely can take lots of instagramable shots here The food choices are not relatively much, but taste okay Use bamboo straw for drinks ‚≠ê eco-friendly Good service"
Medja Restaurant,olivia catherine,4.0,"The best thing of this restaurant is the view and its ambience. The food taste is not bad with little bit expensive price. But it's worthy enough when you see the garden and decoration view of restaurant. You better have a little bit patient for waiting of your seat on the weekend or holiday event. Also order time will take little bit longer than other restaurant, because this restaurant has so many tables separated in differents areas. Hope they can fix their service next time."
Medja Restaurant,Emilia,5.0,Fancy restaurant with delicious food. The parking lot is spacious. There is a nice mushola. Good place for meeting and hangout with friends. Better make a reservation first because it very crowded in the evening. It is not recommended to bring kids here for safety reason.
Medja Restaurant,Sulisthio Tjong,5.0,"High-end restaurant, very nice and chic interior, the foods are good its indonesian fushion style, around idr 75.000 per pax, spacious parking, very pack in the peak time such as lunch and dinner, open at 11 am, 11.30 already packed because of the pandemic situation they only operate 50% capacity. Very Instagramable. Easy to reach from Jakarta"
Medja Restaurant,Yoseph ‚ÄúSimeon‚Äù Dwi,4.0,An artistically arranged restaurant and a spacious room indoor and outdoor area with a small garden and pool. Unfortunately most plants indoor are made of plastic. Spacious and orderly parking area. We recommend making a reservation instead of just walk in. Varied menu with delicious Indonesian flavors. Specifically designed cutlery.
Medja Restaurant,denny adrian,5.0,"One of the best cafe/restaurant in BOGOR..all the food menu was great..dont try to come om weekend,,you will not get any space its always full booked."

Medja Restaurant,Ira Susana,4.0,"We went there for dinner, last order. This resto is one of Bogor‚Äôs instagramable place to hang out with friends and family.

Medja Restaurant,Sandra Salzani,2.0,"Not really that impressed. All they have is only great place in my opinion. Will never come back again for any reason. Firstly, the service is very poor. I was upset for the waitress not explaining their signature dishes as she said it is the kitchen secret. Like wtf??? Furthermore I juat ordered to kill my curiousity AND ENDED UP NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL. Funny. My only ""okay"" food that I ordered is only Udang Segobang. Furthermore, I am not recommending to visit here or order any food at all. The price is too high compared to what you had. The taste is very so so. Please just don't waste your time and money for something unworthy."
Medja Restaurant,Sara Ajiwibawa,4.0,"Unique restaurant with a modern design, perfect for a gathering place with friends. The location is easy to find and the parking is free. The most interesting thing is that the servants who work there are always happy to help to take photos. very helpful for us who really won't welcome photo opportunities in this unique place. The mosque provided is very clean and comfortable, it's just that the prayer room for girls and boys is unclear so I had time to enter the mosque for a guy. What is lacking from this restaurant is that the food variants provided are less varied so the choices are limited. Oh yeah I'm also happy here because it provides brown rice üíï So, it's worth a try especially those of you who are hobbies on Instagramable photo hunting üòä"
Medja Restaurant,Revita Tiaman,5.0,"the place and ambience is quite good. i came at noon, so not all area is opened. the food is also good but the portion is very small for iga penyet. Parking: large parking available"

Medja Restaurant,Timothy Widjaya,5.0,"During my visit on this Caf√©, I couldn't shake of the feeling or vibes that I've had at this place. It sorta feels like UNION Caf√© that are really popular for teenagers these days at my city. The environment are really peaceful, and not too bustling although it is a caf√©, so it really depends on the people during the time. It really is a good place to take pictures with friends, families, and so on. While also happens to be a good place to hang-out, and chill. The food & beverages here are pretty standard in-terms of price (well.. it is a caf√©). Although there are a few menus which I'd like to recommend, which Pisang Goreng is one of them. I really like this ÀÉ·¥óÀÇ (it is the one on the picture below) Do I like my visit to this place ? Well, yes I did. And I really recommend for you to give this place a try if you have the time!

Medja Restaurant,ViVi Di,2.0,"This big and elegance restaurant is so famous around Bogor,the beautiful view with pools and trees are awesome,but the food taste that bad,i'm so sorry but when i ordered nasi goreng kampung it tasted so standard,lidah cabe ijo taste plain and serve cold,empal gentong tasted like jamu than another empal gentong that i've been eat before.

Medja Restaurant,Anggia Anggraini,5.0,"Beautiful restaurant. The foods were delicious and came in big portions. It was quite packed on the weekends. We had to wait for almost an hour. During the pandemic, you have to wait inside your car (in the parking lot) until they call your queue number."

Medja Restaurant,Max Krijthe,3.0,"This place has a lot of potential, but the bad communication between the bar, kitchen and tables is killing this potential. The place really looks fantastic, you can judge by checking the posted photos. About the communication; we waited for 30 minutes for our drinks and the food.... Some of us waited for like 1 hour others 2.5 hours! We were with a group of 10 persons. Nevertheless we shouldnt wait this long!"

Medja Restaurant,Keisha Glori,5.0,"Affordable yet very delicious food in a lovely environment for a hangout, date, or even family time"
Medja Restaurant,Christian Susanto,2.0,"This should be re-named to Medja Cafe instead of Medja Restaurant. Why? The ambience is good, but the food is awful. Most of the dishes are dry. If you want just to take photo, it's good. But if you want a nice food to spend weekend with, just skip. Should improve the food quality. Because ambience is temporary. If you want a long term, the ambience alone is not that good. Definitely wouldnt repeat."

Medja Restaurant,Vera D Damayanti,5.0,"Medja is a fancy restaurant with instagrammable setting. They serve the local-taste dish, cakes, and diverse beverage, including traditional drinks and coffee. Maybe because the interior and outdoor design is quite distinct, the prices of the food and drink become a bit expensive yet the taste is just ok."
Medja Restaurant,Edith Utami,4.0,"The queue was too long. Waited for more than an hour but there were actually several vacant tables inside, that were not yet cleaned up. Better to make reservation before coming here. The food was quite delicious though, and the interior was beautiful."

Medja Restaurant,Simply Niek,3.0,"Just another fancy place to eat. Medja has this beautiful ambient, cozy and beautifully decorated interior. With this long pond in the middle of the premises that give quite stunning effect as you enter the restaurant. As for the food, they serves traditional dishes which taste OK.

The price is also reasonably cheap around Rp 60k for a whole chicken. Love the escargot. Buttery, oily and really appetizing. Recommended. The onion ring is also delightful. I don't know if they have non smoking area for guest who don't smoke or with children. Overall it is recommended."
Restoran The Volcano,Gladwin Suryatin,5.0,Grilled rotisserie chicken and beers. Perfect for a night out with friends. It tastes great and the price isn't too shabby either. Don't miss out on happy hour around 6 to 8 for cheaper beer.

Restoran The Volcano,levanya charissa,5.0,"It's very recommended! here you can eat delicious and as much as you want. I ordered 1 chicken with french fries for 3 people and it was full. and the most delicious is the sauce seasoning, there are many choices and you can mix according to what you want. the price is not too expensive in my opinion, and you can order beer or other alcoholic drinks. very suitable for a good meal and relaxing with friends. But the place is too small so if it's crowded there will be a waiting list."
Restoran The Volcano,Dwi Lejeune,5.0,we order 1 whole chicken (very tender and juicy)and i really love their potato wedges very good seasoned
Restoran The Volcano,Rheine Adithia,4.0,"The food was great, we tried their famous smoked chicken, and the meat was really juicy! They got lot of sauce that you can use as the side while you eat the chicken. The only downside of eating here was the smoke smell in the room. You can accompany your chicken with some beer too, but there is non alcohol drinks available too. Recommended for adults but not for children"
Restoran The Volcano,Seno Prasetyo,5.0,"Place : the place is located in very strategic location , easy to reach and find , but the road is need to be fixed (lots of pothole) Price : the price in this complex is average , lots of stuff that you can find. Service : the staff is very friendly and helpful Parking : the parking spot is very tight for big car to maneuver Cleanliness : the restaurant is clean and well maintained , despite its small space Taste : must have the whole grilled chicken and the snail escargot , its so good , and the draught beer too , perfect companion"
Restoran The Volcano,Alvin Kurniadi,3.0,It looked entycing from a far. But it's nothing special the portion is kinda small and the price is rather steep. The roast chiken is kinda ok albeit slighly unbalance in spice distribution. Overall ok experience. The staff is nice though.

Restoran The Volcano,tanjung herman,3.0,Place for beer and snacks. Grill chicken is the favorite here
Restoran The Volcano,Andreas haynes,5.0,"I found this place by coincidence surving the web for a place in Bandung to spend the evening having some pub grub and chilled beers. If you don't know the exact location it may take you some time to find the place. It is a restobar serving Beer Bintang, San Miquel and Guiness on draft along with a wide selection of bottled beers. Soju, J√§germeister, Bali wines by glass as well as a small selection of imported bottled wines @ approx. RP 550,000.00 a bottle @ are also available. Centerpiece of the restaurant are the 2 rotisserie ovens in which a seemingly endless swarm of chicken are being grilled and served in the restaurant or as take away. Prices are well managed a 1,3kg bird comes at about RP 54,000.00. It is juicy and tender and such a pleasant surprice . Also try the escargeau which are at RP 30,000.00 per dozen served with french bread a real bargain. Stay away from the grilled sausages and deepfried onion rings ... they use rice flour to make the batter which is very unpleasant. The restaurant offers a limited number of outdoor seatings which I prefer as the lighting is better and it is nice and fresh outside. Inside is very dark faintly lit by red lamps which could have come out of a stripper bar. All in all a very nice experience and place to spend an evening enjoying most probably the best chicken in West Java . The waitresses are very friendly and very attentive. I will definately go there again."
Restoran The Volcano,Marsaulina Clarissa,5.0,"Roasted chicken + beer, what more do you ask for? While you're here, also try the escargot. Buttery with herb and spices, it will make you want to ask for more."

Restoran The Volcano,Anonymous 777,5.0,"An Explosive VOLCANO!!! Exploding not with molten lava and hot poisonuous gases, but with mouth-watering dishes and menus. A lot of choices of drinks to drain-down and to cool-down the eruptions. Grilled-chicken is almost exactly the same as I expected. Prices are very competative, as compared to other watering-holes and restaurants at the same degree. Unfotunately, the place is a bit hidden in-between other commercial stalls."
Restoran The Volcano,Gloria Caeli,5.0,Finger lickin' good. So worth the price & the chicken marinate is very delicious. Been a regular here & it's never disappointing.

Restoran The Volcano,Mped Low,5.0,"I'm new to Bandung and this is a great little watering hole. Cold beer and good vibe. Off the beaten track a bit, but seemed to be well known to locals and bules alike. Off the tap beer and generous Happy Hour every afternoon. Good pub food and roast chickens. Highly recommended!"
Restoran The Volcano,Ricky Ryan,4.0,"It's famous for whole roasted chicken , good taste and affordable price. Sometimes the chicken just way to dry but it's kinda random, Other time you get the juicy one. My guess too much heat exposure evaporate moisture of some of those chicken You need injecting those chicken with brine if you wanted to keep those chicken juicy or just simply take them away and replace with new one."
Restoran The Volcano,Ivan N,3.0,"Nice food, ok price. Roasted chicken is delish. The setting not family friendly. Waiter is nice, one a bit rude"
Restoran The Volcano,Nicco Avinta,5.0,This place is a great place to hang out with friends over some food and beer. The chicken is the best roasted chicken in town with the most reasonable price. The meat is thick and the seasoning is just right. One whole chicken can feed up to 4 people. The beer promo is quite crazy. They offer 3 big bottle of beer or 5 small bottles for 100-140k. Just right for 3-4 people. The vibe and atmosphere is very suitable for hanging out with friends. And the bar is very cozy. They usually tune the TV to football matches. There are a lot of foreigners who visit this place thus this place is very foreigners friendly.
Restoran The Volcano,Vania Mathilda,5.0,"My favorite grilled chicken in town, very recommended"
Restoran The Volcano,The One,5.0,"Are you craving for roast chicken late night? So this is the place for you. Famous for its roast chicken with home made sauce and other western dishes. Good place for having a beer or two with friends. Open until midnight. Seating is a bit limited if you come for dinner time, expect to wait around 15 minutes or longer. Homey atmosphere and friendly service."
Restoran The Volcano,Kevin Jonathan,5.0,"No comments, foods are great, drinks are great. I ordered a whole chicken, escargot, and potato skin. Delish, super worth the price. Awesome sauce. Make your own sauce mix. The beer was fine, but the food, oh my god yum yum."

Restoran The Volcano,geroz strife,5.0,"good place to hang out, best price"
Restoran The Volcano,Edwin Widjonarko,5.0,"The rotisserie chicken is surprisingly very well done. The chicken is juicy, well marinated, and impressive crust. The spices is definitely not one that I'd find in the mainstream US or France, but nonetheless it's very very good. Don't forget the potato wedges too."
Restoran The Volcano,Gregorius Henry,5.0,"Food: This restaurant served wide variation of Belgian dishes in a moderate prices. Some of the foods probably won't deliver exactly like your expectation, but some others are excellent. The top recommendation among all is ""Grilled Chicken"". There are various drinks in here with also decent prices start from tea, coffee, juice, beer, and even wine. But don't ever expect something fancy comes out. Service: Good enough for this kind of restaurant. The waitress cracks a few jokes and welcomes us to the table. They even reminds us about the promotion they have at the moment. Places: Great places to spend your weekend with some of your buddy. You have the option to play pools and darts or simply chats while listening to live music. This place somehow have quite a reputation among foreigners. If you decide to have a dinner with kids around, it is better for you to look at somewhere else because this place isn't your typical family resto."
Restoran The Volcano,Vierce„Åï„Çì,5.0,"The chicken were very delicious, there's also some beer to those who seek for it. Best chicken in town I guess.."
Restoran The Volcano,Rahmahwati Rosidah,4.0,They serve the cheapest price for alcohol.. I love the roasted chicken in here and love the atmosphere as well. The service need to be increased cause I‚Äôm waiting for my chicken around 30 minutes. This place always crowded from Friday night to sunday. I prefer first floor cause second floor is so hot
Restoran The Volcano,F Y,5.0,A real hidden gem on Bandung city! Great food and drinks. We had chicken and escargot. They also serve beer and mojitos. The interior is more likely a pub. But music not too loud. So it is really a great place to meet friends. Open at night.
Restoran The Volcano,Luki Lutvia,2.0,"Chicken was good. I ordered it a few times but this is the first time ordering garlic bread. It taste like it was made yesterday, tough to eat, not fresh and they put a tiny amount of garlic spread.....I can barely taste it.... Oh well!"
Restoran The Volcano,Irving Adrian (Frolickity),5.0,"Volcano have the best tasting and best value rotisserie chicken, creamy bitterballen, killer wedges, reasonably priced beers and much more.When i was still in college, went there every weekend, and now everytime i have business in Bandung, Volcano at setrasari rd. is a must visit place for me."
Restoran The Volcano,Ilyasa Amiry,5.0,"If you're considering eating here, you must try their rotisserie chicken. For around 60k IDR for a whole chicken, it's probably one of the best chicken you'll have. They have other food options too, and from my own experience they're all pretty good. I recommend trying their decent selections of sausages, forget your typical bratwursts and frankfurters. they have unusual selection of sausages such as the Merguez which is a spiced lamb sausages, yes LAMB. But if you want a bang for your buck, again, the chicken is where it's at. If you're iffy about eating in a ""bar"", they have outdoor sitting that makes more of a street food experience."
Restoran The Volcano,Ethan Josiah Effendi,4.0,"A good place to hangout and drink liquor.In this part of the country It is hard to find a place that serves alcoholic drinks freely. So that is why I am surprised when I stumbled upon this restaurant/bar that not only sells liquor but also had tons of delicious western dishes. Worth a visit, but not too family friendly, especially don't come at night if you are the conservative type."
Restoran The Volcano,Legend Ashton,5.0,"Very nice venue. They sell many different kinds of beers at reasonable prices. We didn't try the food, but it looked quite good and variated. The bar has a couple of big TVs and it's decorated with football ornamentals (mostly Belgian), and the vibes are really good, the audience is young and the stuff are quite friendly. It's a bit small, so don't know how they'll deal with many customers, but I definitely recommend the visit if you are in Bandung."
Restoran The Volcano,Ronald Adriano,5.0,"Good food, friends, beer. Who cares bout some roaches n rats right? Great place for solitaire. Excellent bronx ambiance. Belgian chicken favourite. I eat that EVERY visit. Never absent."
Restoran The Volcano,Bernd Rehder,4.0,"Favourate watering hole in Bandung. Always a crowd. Nice food centred around chicken from the spit and the beer is cold and cheap. Don't miss it, when you are in town and thirsty."

Restoran The Volcano,Seventeen Seventeen,1.0,"Ordered many times usually via Gofood, but last few times they always gave us uncooked roasted chickens, inside is still bloody, raw, hard and not cooked, we still held our peace and did not complain. However, we just ordered today and told the gojek driver to inform the resto specific notes (to ensure the chicken is juicy, well-cooked, not skinny and dried) yet the staff laughed at the driver and despised the requests. And when we received the chicken, it is awful! Still uncooked, bloody and hard to eat. It is so unprofessional how the staff deals with customers. Pls have a manner! Very very insulting and shameful!"

The packaging uses a box, guys, it's neat too.. but the portion is small, you know hehe.. the white rice is also a little bit, it's like eating directly there.. the side dishes are cassava leaves, jackfruit curry, the jackfruit is really soft.. then the green chili sauce, the sauce is solid, and the rendang seasoning, although the portion is super minimal, but it's delicious, the rendang seasoning is very good, the beef flakes are a little bit, and it's soft. never mind.. About the price? Yes you know hehehe (Original) Sore-sore bingung mo makan apa, akhirnya ojol naspad ini.. aku pesen yg pakai Telor bulat balado.

Restoran Numani,RKspeed19,2.0,"(Translated by Google) I was a bus group from Kalimantan, when I stopped by for dinner, I was very disappointed with the cleanliness, especially the plates. When I ate the buffet, I took a plate from the pile of available plates, how come it looks still wet (not dry) then I took the initiative to hold the center of the plate. I was surprised that the plate was still slippery, oily, not rough. I was so curious that I smelled the plate still smells really fishy, ‚Äã‚ÄãI want to complain, it's not good because I am with the group. Finally, especially for myself, I wash my dishes in hand washing using the available hand soap so that it is hygienic. I'm sorry, I have to share it here so that you can all clean up, I'm worried that after washing the dishes, there isn't much soap or if you wipe it with a cloth that is very unfit for use, causing the dishes to stink. The results of my share are official from my experience, not because of the intention to bring down. Apart from that, okay, there is no problem with good food, good service, there is a prayer room, there are toilets, a large parking lot, security is maintained. (Original) Saya rombongan bus dari kalimantan waktu mampir makan malam sangat kecewa sama kebersihan nya, terutama sama piringnya. Waktu makan prasmanan saya ambil piring di tumpukan piring yang tersedia kok terlihat masih basah (tidak kering) lalu saya inisiatif pegang bagian tengah piring betapa kagetnya piring masih licin berminyak tidak kesat saking penasaran saya cium kok piring masih bau amis banget, mau komplain gak enak karna saya bersama rombongan. Akhirnya khusus saya sendiri piring saya cuci di pencucian tangan pake sabun tangan yang tersedia biar higenis. Mohon maaf, terpaksa saya share disini biar sekalian berbenah, khawatirnya abis di cuci piring sabun kurang banyak atau di lap sama kain yang sudah sangat tidak layak pakai sehingga mengakibatkan piring jadi bau. Hasil share saya resmi dari pengalaman saya bukan karna niat ingin menjatuhkan. Selain itu oke gak ada masalah makanan enak, pelayanan bagus, musholla ada, wc ada, halaman parkir luas, keamanan terjaga."

Restoran Numani,Dootie_ Mo,1.0,"(Translated by Google) I don't recommend to stop by guys. When me and kluarga ate in this restaurant the waiter was in a hurry. And the food deliveryman didn't know when I asked what menu. Tasted foods tend to be salty. The squid is either overcooked or already frezeer but it's hard and not fresh. I ordered the shrimp water spinach, but the one served without shrimp, I tried to go to the food delivery, he replied, ""I don't know, I asked first"". So up to 2 people, and the third person is new if the food runs out. Yes, please confirm first, if the shrimp water spinach is finished, then just plain water spinach is served. Order the broiled shrimp with butter, which comes like spicy sweet shrimp. After I asked he said it was so, oh okay sorry I mispercepted the menu. Eating there gets 10% VAT, I don't know what the Vat rules are. (Original) Kurang saya sarankan untuk mampir gaes. Saat saya dan kluarga makan diresto ini pelayannya buru2. Dan si pengantar makanan pun tidak tau saat saya tanya ini menu apa. Makanan tasted nya cenderung ke asin. Cumi nya entah overcook ato udah dr frezeer tp pokoknya keras dan tidak fresh rasanya. Saya pesan cah kangkung udang namun yg disajikan tanpa udang, saya coba tnya ke pengantar makanan jawabnya ‚Äú saya ga tau, saya tanya kan dulu‚Äù. Begitu hingga 2 orang, dan org ketiga baru blg kalo udangnya habis. Lha mbok ya konfirm dulu kalo cah kangkung udang habis, jgn tiba2 disajikan aja cah kangkung biasa. Pesan udang galah bakar mentega, yang datang kok kayak udang pedas manis. Setelah saya tanyakan katanya emang begitu, oh oke maaf saya salah persepsi menu. Makan di situ kena Ppn 10%, saya ga tau sih gmn aturan Ppn."
