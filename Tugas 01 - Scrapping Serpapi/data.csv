karteenknee karteenknee,2.0,hotel was pretty old the lighting in the room is quite dim as there is no main light the ac is not cold enough ans you have to wait mins the carpet along the corridor not to mention the wall the staff said our room is in the new building i doubted it at the same time i wondered what would old building look like if i were in the new one i believe there are more better hotels at this price range and lastly their staff will surely respond to this review by using their template answer for sure this gonna be my last visit
Faqih Alfatih,4.0,an old building but still quite functioning has a painfully slow and small elevator so guests have to wait several minutes just to get to the lobby the rooms and services are great the foods are excellent and personally the vibes kinda ominous 
Dwi Suseno,4.0,old hotel but still comfortable enough to stay there because the area is limited for parking needs hotel staff especially if there is an event being held at the hotel the thing that needs to be improved is the leaking water faucet in the bathtub rooms service location hotel highlights great value eco friendly more
Cyril Draws,4.0,strategic location room was okay pretty old parking area in the basement which wasn t big enough swimming pool quite small the food was nicerooms service location more
Kamlesh RC,1.0,the ac in the room was not cold tried to call the reception but later realized that i could not call as the phone was broken had to go down and met with mr fergan in front desk and he said the technician was attending to another troubled ac room and will come to mine i also asked to talk to the manager on duty he tried to change the topic as not to disturb the mod after insisting his friend agreed to call the technician came with a mid size can and wanted to service our ac by adding freon i objected and was moved to another room this happened between pm to pm we moved to another room the mod mr gunawan was very helpful but all other staff seems to care less next morning wanted to talk to the manager but they refused as thr manager was on holiday i asked if i can be called by the manager and they said yes a mr dimas took my number but no one called back from the hotel overall a bad experience this is an old hotel condition of the walls needs repairing and repaint the air inside the hotel rooms are a bit stuffy ants are fast to assemble at any food kept on the table basically

Arrakh TV,1.0,hot water is not working the building seems old and not maintenanced yet
Amir Syafrudin,3.0,i stayed in this hotel for night the location was easy to reach it s quite strategic but it had the feel of an old hotel the staff was friendly the only problem was the room it was a smoking room even though i remember to order a non smoking room via traveloka maybe it got mixed up i didn t really check because it was already late and i was exhausted from my trip one funny thing though i strongly remember that i ordered a double bed i m staying with my wife but i got a single bed that was deliberately arranged to be a double bed that one was quite hilarious me and my wife both laugh when we saw the bed in all it s decent enough but i don t think i ll put this hotel a bit lower on my list of preferred accomodations 
Calvin Perdana,5.0,the staff are very helpful the room and its breakfast is okay with the price they given to me if you want to see semarang skylines at night please order the highest floor on the east side of the hotel unfortunately i got north side 
Andi Dianni Anggraini,2.0,we booked last minute for one night for transit we chose family room checked in and went out until late night we fell asleep and when we woke up we found some dry blood spot from someone s period on our bed sheet and cover we had breakfast this morning they only have papayas on the fruit counter and my daughter found hairs yes multiple in her fried rice made her stop eating i choose soto semarang but quite disappointed because the beansprout looked unhealthy the omelette was so dry i know we are in the middle of pandemic situation we have limitations but there were quite many guests stayed in the hotel and the hotel supposed to pay more attention to these things especially the foods the served and the room was clean but the bed the one thing supposedly the most clean was quite gross and also our toilet can t flush because the flush handle was broken 
Gunawan Anindyamantri,5.0,located in the center of the city which also near to gift shops only minutes walk this hotel not only have comfortable rooms but also good breakfast with various foods beverages the staff also good perform friendly price three words it s worthed another thing you can find here is that some of rooms have completed with smart tv so you are not only may watch local channel but also netflix youtube etc

Hengky Mokoginta,5.0,old style hotel but good clean comfort and affordable price 
Heru Heru,2.0,hotel that looks old and smell old unless you have to stay in city center it s best to look somewhere else insufficient parking space getting in and out of tight parking area need some acrobatic skill one of the saving grace for this hotel is the breakfast which is varied other than the coffee taste are generally quite good 
Bray Wok,3.0,it is quite an old hotel with plenty of rooms a bit out dated nothing special on the buffet breakfast the good thing about this place is the strategic location right within the center of the city the spacious basement parking lot is another additional value to this hotel

Brahmanto Anindito,4.0,i was with my wife and daughter in superior deluxe room no the hotel is located at the main street which is pretty noisy but the bright side is it s near everywhere they had good hospitality from office boy receptionist to security i also love the swimming pool it s a cozy ambiance not crowded be it week days or week end the water is crystal unfortunately it s only one meter deep

Mawar Kusumawardani,5.0,nice hotel nice and friendly staffs it s located strategically surrounded by places and store that would be sufficient for a tourist the room was cozy the bed was so comfortable and the pool it s cute for me 
Bismi Rakasiwi,4.0,the rooms are pretty nice with big windows fast internet and a good shower the staff are friendly their pool is not that big but it is never busy they also have a variety options for breakfast they usually have an aerobic class every monday at the gym however the lights are not quite right the room is dark at night and it is kinda depressing their beds are not comfy i had a hard time to fall asleep there 
Cia,4.0,like the interior of the hotel it feels so traditional and the aromatic inside the building was so relaxing nice service too except for thing at the corner basement parking area where there s some kind of machine that sounds so loud it stinks so much it smells not soo good i got a headache smelling it i hope they maintain their place more but it s not a problem if u park your car because that machine located near motorcycle parking area thank you 
arief kas,5.0,hotel tua yg nyaman di semarang cuma berjarak m dari simpang lima breakfast was standard n less variety the taste was standard you get what you pay but it s good for a short trip coz nearby to pusat oleh n food centre 
Fadhil Hidayat,3.0,strategic location the breakfast menu is tasty and quite varied the room is nice with a cupboard a cable tv and refrigerator however it is so many mosquitoes in the room especially in rd floor near from the swimming pool dirty slimy and slippery swimming pool small lobby car port and small parking lot the decor is rather outdated

Sivvis (Sivvis),4.0,good hotel for a good price there s not much more to it free breakfast is ok but better than many other hotels in the same price range waterpressure was a bit low the bed was good and the tv has enough channel to keep me entertained i stayed night 
Crisopras “YΛVL” Kainama,5.0,read this knowing that millions of people around the world would be watching in person and on television and expecting great things from him at least one more gold medal for america if not another world record during this his fourth and surely his last appearance in the world olympics and realizing that his legs could no longer carry him down the runway with the same blazing speed and confidence in making a huge eye popping leap that they were capable of a few years ago when he set world records in the meter dash and in the meter relay and won a silver medal in the long jump the renowned sprinter and track and field personality carl lewis who had known pressure from fans and media before but never even as a professional runner this kind of pressure madeonly a few appearances in races during the few months before the summer olympics in atlanta georgia partly because he was afraid of raising expectations even higher and he did not want to be distracted by interviews and adoring fans who would follow him into stores and restaurants demanding autographs and photo opportunities but mostly because he wanted to conserve his energies and concentrate like a martial arts expert on the job at hand winning his favorite competition the long jump and bringing home another gold medal for the united states the most fitting conclusion to his brilliant career in track and field 
Agus Wahyuadianto,5.0,it is my second visit here cheap and clean are still the best features the cramped parking lot is compensated by skillful and free of charge vallet service i haven t tried the gym pool and breakfast though i might revise this review later 
RASHEED PUTRANTO,3.0,it s an ok hotel what else do i expect from an old hotel not really much going on there s a swimming pool haven t tried it though the food is also an ok rating not much of an option but it s food
Joko Christian,4.0,good old hotel with clean bathrooms and adequate facilities wifi is good breakfast is good a gym swimming pool good layout but somewhat limited parking lot and long hallways needs to be traveled between lobby and passenger elevator to rooms located in city center not so far from simpang lima min by car or minutes walk photos attached are swimming pool and family room with seperate beds 
Rizca Nur Afivtya Puteri,4.0,i like this hotel it s compact clean and comfortable it has its own swimming pool but the th floor and above has its own elevator at the back of the hotel that time i didn t know it i used the front elevator and ended up entering a really dark hall smh but overall it was fine 
Nora Valk,2.0,when i first came to pandanaran years ago i fell in love with my room i picked the hotel via google for its location i have come back ever year either alone or w family members number one for the staff they are so thoughtful helpful and kind now almost like family but unfortunately the hotel needs alot of renovations and very important additons for the safety of older people nr is a hand railing by the front entrance steps nr hand railings by the swimming pool the first two years the tv stations were international with cnn bbc abc etc now it is completely local not good breakfast is the best both tradtional and international clean sheets and towels daily however i will look for the very necessary renovations of the rooms bathrooms hallways and swimming pool thank you pak gunawan ibu restu and ibu ira when i fell down and you rushed me personally to the clinic to be checked and given medication and all the after care i hope to come back sampai jumpa 
Vicky Sabadius,3.0,old hotel moderate room clean good food good location nice staff
budi mega prasetyo,4.0,value for money for family weekend among the cheapest rate for family room strategic location to spend your weekend in the center of semarang and if you lucky you can walk in the morning and join semarang s car free day on sunday some old fasility need to upgrade restaurant need more light
Gio Taufan (Disgiovery),3.0,some old hotels can have some comfy and nice atmosphere while pandanaran hotel for me feels like a bit jam packed the hotel restaurant can get really crowded during breakfast time but if you are in group i suggest you to try nasi branjangan specially provided by the hotel by prior order it s like nasi liwet style where we get together having the traditional feast the room i stayed in had a really nice cityscape from its hotel window 
E.A.P.,5.0,i do like the vibes of this hotel spacious and clean room with reasonable price and licated in the city center near to simpang lima friendly staff and they even called me to make sure about room and when i arrive and my room has been upgraded to the larger one thank you so much 
Matze Ko,4.0,the pandanaran hotel scores with it s very central location the kind staff the pool and the clean rooms even if they are not the newest anymore the pool is located an a more or less roof top on the rd floor and the opening hours are quite long am pm furthermore you can rent a scooter i think it was more or less a private rental from a hotel employee but it was very easy and cheap idr hours all in all a very recommended stay in semarang 
key,3.0,when you first look at this hotel you will think that this hotel is fancy but once you go to the receptionist you would know that this hotel is a mess the ornaments on this hotel is disorganized in fact i felt really insecure because it looks kinda creepy to me the room also smells funny and there s so many things that already broken i don t really mind but i hope they fix this problem asap
